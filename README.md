## Introduction

Detecting nutrient deficiencies in black pepper plants can help farmers take timely actions to improve crop yield and quality. This project leverages machine learning to provide accurate and quick detection based on images of the plants.

## Features

- **User Interface**: An interactive web interface to upload images of black pepper plants.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A TensorFlow and Keras-based model to predict nutrient deficiencies.
- **Backend Server**: Flask-based backend to handle requests and serve predictions.
- **Data Processing**: Image pre-processing and data handling using Python libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Other Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nutrient-deficiency-detection.git
    cd nutrient-deficiency-detection
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask server:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Open your browser and navigate to:**

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the web interface in your browser.
2. Upload an image of a black pepper plant.
3. The system will process the image and display the predicted nutrient deficiency.

## Model Training

If you wish to train the model from scratch, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the dataset:**
    - Organize your images into appropriate directories for each deficiency type.
2. **Run the training script:**

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Save the trained model:**
    - The trained model will be saved in the `models` directory.
